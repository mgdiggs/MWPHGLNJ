<!--<p>On behalf of the Officers and Members of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge Free & Accepted Masons, State of New Jersey, we are asking for your help.</p>

<p>This letter is a request that you continue to support our Annual Charity Raffle program by granting permission to the bearer of this letter to solicit ticket sales on or around your premises. The net proceeds from our Annual Charity Raffle will be used by our fraternal organization to fulfill our obligations to a number of charitable organizations that we have committed to support over the next Masonic Year. We believe in helping others and working to better our respective communities. This is the 34th year that we have undertaken our Annual Charity Raffle Program and we are hoping to have a banner year in raising money for Charity.  The drawing will be held in Red Bank, New Jersey on the date and time prescribed on the raffle ticket.</p>

<p>Please allow our local Lodges to solicit the sale of our Annual Charity Raffle tickets at your establishment.  Your support of this worthwhile endeavor and your act of charity is greatly appreciated. Thanks for all your help.</p>
