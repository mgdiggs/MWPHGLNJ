<p><h2>MW Ricardo McNeil<h2>
 <h1>Most Worshipful Grand Master</h1>
 <h3>of all Prince Hall Masons</h3>
 <h4>State of New Jersey</h4></p>
 
<p><span style='font-size:30px;'>F</span>irst recognizing the presence of God and his divine guidance over my life, giving Him all the honor, all the praise and all the glory for the manifold blessings and comforts that has rained down on me, Thank You Father.</p>

<p>When you are rewarded for hard work you should be overjoyed with the acknowledgement, understanding that to he who is much given much is expected. I do recognize that it is a reward bestowed upon me by the Craft to serve as the Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand, Free and Accepted Masons, of the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p>I believe that my steps have been ordered by the Supreme Architect of the Universe and throughout my life’s journey, even today, He has placed angels in the form of providers, protectors,instructors and guides around me from birth, if it had not been for God on my side, none of this would be possible. So I take this opportunity, this moment to reflect, and give thanks to He who has kept his hand in mine and has forgiven my sins, committed by thought, word, and deed; He has looked past my faults and provided every single one of my needs, my dear Lord and Savior,  I give you all the Honor, all the Glory and all the Praise, and whatever tomorrow or tomorrows, tomorrow brings, I pray that since you brought me to it, you will continue to take me through it.</p>

<p>As I stand here as your Grand Master, my mind and heart are in a tug of war, my mind is recalling all of those moments when my parents fought for me, encourage me and yes, did not spare the rod on me; for all of those individual moments has shaped me into the man that you see today, I can hear Momma (Doris Walton) saying, “now Ricky, you can’t expect everyone to do things the way you would and you must not be so critical of others, because if you alienate those who you will have to work with, you will be on an island by yourself, no man is an island and no man wants to be alone, so sometimes you have to go along with someone else’s idea and make sure that it works for the good of all; then I can hear my Father, Chubby (Charles Walton), admonishing me to stay home and be involved in every aspect of your family’s life, instructing me that a father must do what is necessary to provide for his family,  even if that meant working two or three jobs; just a few months prior to his death, in one of those edge of the bed, flicking the remote moments with just he and I, he sits up and says I’m proud of you , you have done a good job providing for your family and raising your children. Then there was my Uncles, my Mother’s Brothers, each one of them has invested some wisdom that I use every day; the youngest brother, Uncle Irvine (Dawson), would say “don’t expect nobody to do for you, get an education and do for yourself”, my uncle Rainbow (Raymond Dawson), when I thought that I was slick and trying to get over,  would say “you playing games with yourself”; my uncle Pop (Norman Dawson), would say “you have to have some street sense, don’t let nobody push you around and be ready to fight on a moment’s notice”, and then there was my uncle Gus (Augustus Dawson) the patriarch of the family, who took me under his wing and taught me how to be a business man, by training me in the  hardware business and teaching me how to make a living with my hands and mind, that hardware store provided me the financial wherewithal to pay my college tuition.</p>   

<p>I stand here perched upon all of their shoulders, and I say thank you.  Then there were those outside of the family realm, the Judge Irvine Bookers, the Councilman Bradleys, the Louis Glens, and Sidney Jordan’s of the world, men that saw something in me, inside and outside of masonry who I will forever be indebted. R.W. Louis Glen pushed and R.W. Sidney Jordan pulled me along this Masonic journey, so yes, as I stand here with a sense of melancholy engulfing my heart and mind because three of these influential men, my parents and all uncles except one have earned and  received the reward of an eternal, peaceful rest, and are not here to share in this moment with  me,  but when I close my eyes, I can see a balcony, all my dearly departed family and friends, standing, high fiving each other, saying well done to each other for their part in what you see standing before you today, so I say thank you.</p>

<p>Then there are those who God have spared to see their hard work and determination be rewarded by allowing a member of their Cherish Lodge, Golden Rule Lodge No. 24 rise to the apex of this Great Fraternity to serve as Grand Master. When the lodge fell on hard times, they literally carried the lodge in the back of their car, holding meetings and schools of instructions at their homes all because they refused to allow their beloved lodge to be reduced to rubble like the first temple; you may or may not know who they are, but I do, and I will forever be grateful for R.W. Otis Appling, R.W. Alvin Mitchell, R.W. Henry Wiley, R.W. Arnold Williams, R.W. Edwin Ross, R.W. Henry Hopkins and many more.</p>  
  
<p>From time to time, I reflect back on the path that I have taken, and some time I play the what if game in my head, and I always end up at this question, “where would I be if God had not had my petitioner, RW Robert White, hold my petition for a year because to quote him, “you not ready yet”, did I say RW, I mean WB Robert White. Thank you Rob. To all the Past Masters and Brothers of Golden Rule Lodge No. 24, Vauxhall New Jersey, all that I’ve achieved, you have achieved, because you are my foundation and when I move or you move, we move just like that, thank you.</p>

<p>To my Wife, who I have forgotten to acknowledge from time to time, she is my soul mate, my life partner, the mother of my children, my biggest supporter and most importantly the love of my life, she tried her best to find a way to get into this room to witness this, but you let her know that I said that she is truly the heart that beats in my chest.   
I have to acknowledge my eldest son, Halim McNeil; he was raised from a dead level to a living perpendicular on the square in June 2012. As a child he and his siblings had no idea what drove me to work so hard, but now that’s he’s a father, he knows that it was all for them, to provide the very best life I could for them. I love you man.</p>

<p>A special acknowledgement goes out to my cousin, Bro.  Clinton Fields, who meets on the level in the Jurisdiction of Florida and those that traveled with him; Clinton and I grew up more like brothers then cousins, even though he grew up in Paterson, he spent the majority of his weekends in the Central Ward of Newark, between 95 Hunterdon Street and his Great Aunts or Grand Mothers. I will save those life lessons for another day, Thank you my Brothers.</p> 

<p>Certainly to all of the Past Grand Masters, thank you for your guidance and support. A special acknowledgement to MW Thomas P. Caldwell, PGM and MW Harry McDowell, PGM for giving me the opportunity to serve the craft in a Statewide capacity on the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Temple Association.</p>

<p>To my brother and my friend, Most worshipful Robert L. Oglesby, Sr., Past Grand Master, diligences and perseverance in our everyday work is a characteristic often praised in that inestimable gift of God to Man. Hard work results in success and a satisfied life, where as laziness never fulfils our needs. My brother you have truly worked hard, not only these last two years, but your entire Masonic career. These last two years where merely the result of what you had been working for your entire Masonic career, a successful term as Grand Master, you should be satisfied with a job well done, Thank you for your service.</p>  
  
<p>To the Grand Cabinet, my brothers, RW Shelton Jermaine Prescott, Deputy Grand Master and RW Tisan Rashool Dawud, Senor Grand Warden and the new Kid on the Block, RW Jeffrey C. Spann, Junior Grand Warden, MW Ramon E. Nelson, Grand Treasurer and RW James G. “Butter Allen, Grand Secretary, Congratulations. Enjoy the moment, back to the grind, July 6, 2013.  
The solemn oath that I have taken will forever be indelible marked on my heart and mind and will always be reflected upon when executing the duties of my office as Grand Master.  It was said that “I should carefully avoid in the discharge of my duties a haughty demeanor, and no action should be taken in an arbitrary manor. In all instances there is the possibility that these two terms can always creep into the mind and actions of those who have been placed in a leadership capacity, if not careful.”</p>

<p>The word haughty is defined by Merriam-Webster as “blatantly and disdainfully proud.” The word is always used in the Bible in the evil sense of “arrogant, disdainful and setting oneself above others”; it is often set in contrast to being humble. Arbitrary is defined as something that is determined by judgment or whim and not for any specific reason or rule.  It can also be a decision made by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle. I do realize that all that I receive is a gift, for which I am thankful. It is my humble prayer that God would continue to bless me with a humble heart and all that I do would first be to his Honor and Glory and then for the betterment of the craft at large. It will be my practice to make all decision based on the facts presented or known at the time, in compliance with the book of Constitution and Bylaws adopted by this August body and what’s best for the craft.    
The Masonic system is designed to invest it votaries with the tools required to teach them that, all that they do for themselves is vanity, but what they do to promote the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man will last for eternity and those who strive for perfection on earth by exhibiting unconditional love for their fellow man with a pure heart will inherit the Kingdom as promised on Judgment Day.</p>

<p>The three principle rungs of the ladder which Jacob saw extending from Earth to Heaven, was labeled Faith, Hope and Charity, The principle tenants of this great fraternity, is Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth, these attributes demands of us to be our Brothers Keeper. When we consult that inestimable gift of God to man, we learn who will Judge us and on what criteria we will be judged, lifting up Matthew 25:31-40, from the New King James Version (NKJV), , we find these words:</p>  
<b>The Son of Man Will Judge the Nations</b>

<p>31 “When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy[a] angels with Him, and then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 32 All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. 33 And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35 for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; 36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’ 

<p>37 “Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? 38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39 Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ 40 And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ Brethren, the Mottos of this administration for the 2013-2015 Masonic year will be “We are our Brother’s Keeper” 
The Scripture comes from Matthew 25:40 “ and the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me”.

<p>Let all that we do, be done not for our own glorification, but to first glorify God and secondly the Fraternity. In that Order we will fulfill the charge given, and I’m convinced that God will grow our numbers. 
In closing, I will recite a few lyrics of this little children’s gospel song, that most of us have sung since we were knee high, but for a Master Mason, it should have a more profound meaning:  
This little light of mine I’m gonna let it Shine This little light of mine I’m gonna let it Shine Everywhere I go, I’m gonna let it shine Everywhere I go, I’m gonna let it Shine Let it shine/ Let it Shine / Let it Shine

<p>2013-2015 Masonic Year Mandatory Programs for the Craft  
 Back to Basics – The Grand Lecturer is currently preparing a curriculum to be used to teach our newly initiated Brethren the basic Masonic knowledge needed to advance in our hallowed halls.  We have gotten away from what separated us from those outside the oblong square.  Church Visitation  Black History Program during the month of February, but also throughout the year, when ever speaking in public, take a moment to discuss prominent Prince Hall Masons and their contributions where appropriate.  Community involvement – Adopt a school, participate in Community programs, open the doors of the lodges to Community Groups, partner with the various civic organizations in your communities, Promote Prince Hall Masonry outside the oblong square  and on the streets of your community  Outreach to the Widows, Orphans and the sick and distress  District Wide programs – Bringing awareness to Autistic Black Children and Epilepsy in the Black community.  
Black Children and Autism  African-American children with autism are being diagnosed almost two years later than children of any other ethnic group, holding up their treatment, and in turn, their quality of life, according to research.   
 Autism is a disorder that causes children to lag behind other children in terms of speech, behavior and the way they develop, as well as dealing with everyday tasks. Common early warning signs are noticing your child seems to have trouble with hearing you or talking to you. It can be diagnosed at as early as 18 months, but it's easy for it to go undetected because the aggressive, hyper, eccentric behavior and habits related to autism can easily be viewed as misbehavior. Districts will sponsor awareness programs in their counties with the goal of finding doctors and existing parents of autistic children to provide  answers and advice from parents who’ve lived with autistic children, bring them together under one roof to heighten the awareness and assist were possible. The Doctors are called DAN Doctors, DAN meaning Defeat Autism Now. These are clinicians specially trained by the Autism Research Institute to treat autism. The parents of autistic children that participate in awareness programs are called Generation Rescue Angels.</p>
 
<p>Epilepsy and the African American Community  Epilepsy is a medical condition that produces seizures affecting a variety of mental and physical functions. It’s also called a seizure disorder. When a person has two or more unprovoked seizures, they are considered to have epilepsy. Epilepsy awareness is low among African Africans, due to lack of access to health care and health information, misinformation and stigma associated with the condition.  Through the districts we will attempt to bring attention to this disorder so that those who need help can find it. We will reach out to The Epilepsy Foundation, which is a network of affiliated community-based organizations that work for people with epilepsy and their families to provide access to important services where they live and work.   

<p>Committees of special interest to this Grand Master   William H. Moss Grand Council Order of Pythagoreans – is our future, we must do a better job of supporting their programs, and each council although affiliated with a particular lodge will be adopted by the district.  Burial Fund – Outcome of Motion to Increase Burial Fund Tax – Approved, thanked the Craft for increases the tax to allow for an increased payout to the beneficiaries from $1K w/ 25 of services to $3K w/ five full years of service. Thereby proving that we are our Brothers Keepers.  Charity Foundation – The foundation will be used in conjunction with the Autism and Epilepsy initiative.  Prince Hall Urban Renewal Corp. – refinance to recover dollars spent from the Temple Association some years back, and perform some much need renovations.  Prince Hall Temple Association -   Prince Hall Family Relief -   Communication and Technology – Phone App and Web Page must be functional, 21st century tools for mass communication, available but underutilized.   Grand lodge Combined Choir –This Choir will perform at all public appearances, I’ve spoken with R.W. Gerald Alston, he will spear head this endeavor. I will discuss with the Grand Matron and Patron the use of our sisters in this choir. 
  
<p>My brothers, we are at a cross roads in the jurisdiction of New Jersey, and if we don’t chose properly we will not be able to arrest the downward trend of new membership. The foundation upon which the Prince Hall Family is built is Ancient Craft Masonry or the Blue House. A few months ago, I started collecting data for the purpose of putting together a census to identify the Cities and Counties of this State where we have the most representation; the census was expanded to include the entire Prince Hall Family. What snapped into focus was a fact that we all know, but never discuss, and that is that membership can only come through the blue house./<p> 

<p>We have forty five (45) Lodges, located in seventeen (17) counties and thirty nine (39) cities. If we continue to ignore the lack of growth and allow our lodges to fail because of the lack of support and petty differences,  if we continue to ignore the growth of the Blue House membership while supporting the social affairs of houses that was established to “Improve yourself in Masonry”, if we don’t arrest the problem collectively as a Prince Hall Family, one day and very soon, you will wake up and realize that our foundation, which was built on a solid rock is now on sinking sand. My brother, no matter what station or place you hold in the Prince Hall family, I would ask that you always keep in the forefront of your mind your Blue House and how it can serve those around it and improve its standing in your respective communities.</p>

<p>The Prince Hall name is our Brand – Let’s honor it and promote it, and if we present ourselves as upright Men and Masons our membership will begin to swell again.</p>";

<p>On Saturday, February 8, 1958, at the Newark City Hospital (Harrison S. Martland Medical Center), in the early morning hours of that cold but sunny day, Charles and Doris Walton were blessed with the birth of their only son, Ricardo.  He is one of seven children, six (6) girls and one (1) male child.</p>

<p>Ricardo received his primary and secondary education through the City of Newark Public School system; he attended Robert Treat Elementary School from kindergarten through 5th grade.  As a result of the construction of the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry and the devastation caused by the 1967 riots, the family was forced to relocate from 95 Hunterdon Street, Newark Central Ward (or 3rd Ward) to 77 Summit Ave, Newark South Ward. Ricardo completed his primary education at Chancellor Avenue Elementary School in 1972; he went on to attend Weequahic High School and graduated in 1976.</p>

<p>Post secondary education consisted of three years at Mercer County Community College (MCCC), one and a half years as a full time student and one and a half years as a part time student, earning and receiving an Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) Degree in Civil Engineering Technology, May 1979. Not satisfied with the A.A.S. Degree, Ricardo continued his education at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), graduating in May 1984 (December 1983) with a Bachelors’ of Science in Engineering Technology. It must be noted that he did not burden his parents or take out a loan for college; he worked and eventually managed Dawson’s Hardware Store, located in the South Ward of Newark, and did small home repairs to pay for his post secondary education. It also must be noted that the hardware store was owned by his uncle, Augustus Dawson.</p>

<p>During a road trip to the Southern States to visit family with his mother, celebrating his graduation from MCCC, Ricardo had an epiphany, he realized that he was in love with and missed his then girlfriend, Versie M. Cotten. He called her that evening and professed his love for her and asked that she marry him. Not setting a date, but promising that after he graduates and can provide for a family he would make her his wife. On August 5, 1984 his dream came true and Versie became his wife, and from that union was born three children, Halim Ibn McNeil (married to Ryan), Nicole Aisha McNeil, and Justin Charles W. McNeil.  In addition, Ricardo and Versie are blessed to have three grand children, Zahir H. McNeil, Rian Crawford and Miliah McNeil. His three children has made him very proud, first because of the love that they have for each other, secondly , they all completed  post secondary education (on his dime), and lastly for the God fearing adults that they have become. </p>

<p>Ricardo is employed by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) in the Engineering Department as a Project Engineer. Over the course of his 16 years with the NJTA, Ricardo has successfully managed construction contracts in an aggregate amount of well over three quarters of a billion dollars. In 2005 and 2007, during Public Service Recognition Week, at the New Jersey Excellence through Public Service Awards Programs, he received an Exceptional Service Award and Professional Achievement Award, respectively, for the success of the projects that he was directly responsible for during the periods covered. Ricardo believes that his work ethic and professionalism is the by-product of the 12 years that he spent as a Resident Engineer, with The RBA Group, a Civil / Architectural Firm and the several years he spent in the City of Newark as a Construction Specialist, administering Community Development Block Grant Funds through an array of Neighborhood Improvement programs implemented by the City. Also, the years of service to the South Ward and surrounding communities while employed at Dawson’s Hardware can never be discounted when considering the major experiences that have shaped Ricardo into the service minded person that he is today. He has held some form of employment since his early childhood, starting by delivering the Newark Star Ledger before going to school and the Newark Evening News after school, hard work has never been a stranger to Ricardo.</p> 

<p>Ricardo and his family are members of Saint Matthew AME Church, Orange New Jersey. While attending a mandatory God-Parenting Ministry Class at Saint Matthew and attending the Christening of His God Daughter, Taylor White, the Spirit of the Lord knocked on his heart. He continued to visit Saint Matthew several more times with his family and unknown to them at the time,  he decided to take that leap of faith and carried his wife and three children with him down the aisle to give the Pastor his hand, but more importantly, giving God his Heart. That bright sunny June morning in 1995 was the start of a new beginning for the McNeil Family.</p>

<p>Ricardo is a sports activist; you name it he played it, baseball, softball, basketball, football, racquetball, and paddleball and as recent, golf. He has served as a baseball coach for Irvington P.A.L., President and Captain of the Newark Paddleball Alliance, Paddleball instructor for the Newark Paddleball Academy, and has served on an Advisory Board (early 1980s) for the Newark Hawthorn Avenue Boys Club; Ricardo has always given 110% to anything that he becomes a part of.</p> 

<p>The experiences of Ricardo’s life have forged him into the man that he has become.  In December, 1997 he picked up the implements of Speculative Masonry at Golden Rule Lodge No. 24, Vauxhall, NJ by being initiated into the Great Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, Prince Hall Affiliated. The implements of masonry are now being applied where needed to complete his structure. In June 2009, Ricardo was elected as the Junior Grand Warden which started his journey toward the Grand East. On June 25, 2013, Ricardo was bestowed the distinguished Honor of being Elected and Installed as the Eighty Seventh (87th)   Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons State of New Jersey.  It is hoped and prayed that God will continue to smile upon and bless him to freely give of himself, making his motto come to life “We are our Brothers Keeper, and by so doing, he may inspire others to do the same.<p>

There’s a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place<br>
And I know that it’s the Spirit of the Lord <br>
There are sweet expressions on each face<br> 
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord <br>
Sweet Holy Spirit... sweet heavenly dove...<br> 
Stay right here with us Filling us with Your love<br> 
And for these blessings <br>
We lift our hearts in praise <br>
Without a doubt we’ll know<br> 
That we have been revived <br>
When we shall leave this place
</p>

<p>First giving all honor our praise to the ever living and true God, who brought us to this today, and if that wasn’t enough, think about His Grace and Mercy that has carried Oziel Grand Chapter over the last one hundred years, I don’t know about you but I can’t help but say Thank You Lord.</p>

<p>To Sister Janice E. Justice, Centennial Grand Worthy Matron, to Brother Cecil Allen, Centennial Grand Worthy Patron, to the Elected Grand Chapter Officers, Past Grand Worthy Matrons and Patrons, Visiting Grand Jurisdictions, Certainly to the Grand Chapter of New Jersey, who for the first time is seated in our session, to the Worthy Matrons, Worthy Patrons, Chapter offices, sisters and brothers, good morning.</p>

<p>I bring you greetings on behalf of my office as the eighty seventh (87) Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, State of New Jersey.</p>

<p>One Hundred years of existence is a major milestone for any organization, and should be celebrated. During the last one hundred years there were a number of monumental moments that have affected our life’s; in the first twenty five (25) years, 1913 to 1938, the Harlem Renaissance was born, which marked an era in black literature and art, the second twenty five (25) years, 1938-1963, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order forbidding discrimination in defense industries after pressure from blacks led by A. Philip Randolph; In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, the Supreme Court completed overturning legal school segregation at all levels; Congress passed the voting rights bill of 1957, the first major civil rights legislation in more than 75 years; in the third twenty five (25) years, 1963-1988, Guion (Guy) S. Bluford, Jr. was the first black American astronaut to make a space flight on board the space shuttle Challenger, Shirley Chisholm became the first black congresswoman and began the first of seven terms, Barbara Jordan represented Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1972-78 and was the first African-American congresswoman from the Deep South; in the last twenty five (25) years, 1988-2013, Barack Hussein Obama II, is elected the 44th and current President of the United States, the first African American to hold the office, Janice E. Justice and Cecil Allen elected as Grand Worthy Matron and Grand Worthy Patron, respectively, of the Oziel Grand Chapter Order of the Eastern Star, Prince Hall Affiliation, State of New Jersey. If you think the last one hundred years was amazing, wait to you get a load of the next one Hundred, the best is yet to come, provided that we follow the Will and Guidance of He who has directed the path of our ancestors and have brought us thus far.</p>

<p>Yesterday as I delivered my acceptance address, I could barely hold back the tears, my heart and mind was filled with memories of moments and people in my life who through Gods divine intervention shaped the man that you see in front of you today. I know that I am standing on the shoulders of some giants and I’m grateful. It is my humble prayer that God would continue to bless me with a humble heart and all that I do would first be to his Honor and Glory and then for the betterment of the craft at large. It will be my practice to make all decision based on the facts presented or known at the time, in compliance with the book of Constitution and Bylaws adopted by this August body and what’s best for the craft.</p>

<p>You have heard that my Scripture comes from Matthew 25:40 “And the King will answer and say to them, assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.”</p>

<p>You have heard that my Motto is “We are our Brother’s Keeper”. Every day is filled with test, and remember, how you respond to the test will determine whether or not you hear those words “Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world”, chose wisely when determining whether or not you will partake of the superfluities of life or help your fellow man.</p>

<p><b>The Craft is expected to complete the following program over the next year:</b><br>

 - Church Visitation, continue to nurture and reinforce relationships with the neighboring houses of worship by supporting their programs and ministries as much as possible. <br><br>

 - Black History Program during the month of February, but also throughout the year, when ever speaking in public, take a moment to discuss prominent Prince Hall Masons and their contributions where appropriate.<br><br>

 - Community involvement – Adopt a school, participate in Community programs, open the doors of the lodges to Community Groups, partner with the various civic organizations in your communities, Promote Prince Hall Masonry outside the oblong square and on the streets of your community by organizing drives as needed. <br><br>

 - Outreach to the Widows, Orphans and the sick and distress <br><br>

 - District Wide programs – Bringing awareness to Autistic Black Children and Epilepsy in the Black community.<br></p>

<p>It is my desire that the entire Prince Hall family in the respective Districts support the endeavors of their foundation Lodges. Keeping in mind that the Lodge is in fact the foundation upon which they are erected, and the lodge is the only source of their new membership, so if the Lodges waste away and reduced to rubble, so will they.</p>

<p>As I look out across this room, there is no doubt that we are one family and are bound by the lessons in Masonic virtues exhibited by the five star points:<br>
<b>Adah</b>, Jephthah’s daughter demonstrates respect to the binding force of a vow <br>
<b>Ruth</b>, the widow demonstrates devotion to religious principles<br> 
<b>Esther</b>, the wife demonstrates fidelity to kindred and friends<br> 
<b>Martha</b>, Lazarus’s sister demonstrates undeviating faith in the hour of trial<br> 
<b>Electa</b>, the mother, friend of St. John, demonstrates patience and submission under wrong</p>

<p>Before I take my seat, I will leave these thoughts with you: Live like God will deliver you Live like he works to protect you from harm Cry out to him and put your hardships on display before the Lord Remember, crisis does not come to your life only to steal and cause pain, it is also a birthplace of the miraculous</p>"; 

$charge = "<p>Worshipful Brothers, you have been chosen to be the leaders of your respective lodges, and as such you have obviously throughout your Masonic career demonstrated some leadership traits that have convinced the craft to follow you. The five leadership traits that I believe you have demonstrated are Honesty, Forward-Looking, Competency Inspiration and Intelligence.</p>

<p>It is important to continue to exhibit, model and display these traits throughout your administrative year. It isn’t enough to just be neutral. Sometimes you will have to make a tough unpopular decision; that decision should be based on the facts in front of you in collaboration with three invaluable resources, the Holy Bible, The Grand Lodge Book of Constitution and by-laws, particularly Chapter III, Laws Pertaining to the Lodges, and the By-Laws of your respective lodges. Remember never to preside in an arbitrary (random) or unconstitutional manner.</p>

<p>You will provide to me, by September 1, 2013 the required letter indicating that you have read or had read to you the Book of Constitution (see section 139). This is also required from your Wardens under separate cover.</p>

<p>You are expected to support the programs of this Grand Lodge and see that the implementation of the mandatory programs is carried out in your respective lodges.</p>

<p>Remember to always give some form of light (lecture) at every meeting.</p>

<p>As I dismiss you, I will leave you with the words of our Progenitor, MW Prince Hall</p>

<p>“We by the grace of God, live up to our profession; we may cheerfully go the rounds of the compass of this life, having lived according to the plumb line of uprightness, the square of justice, the level of truth and sincerity. And when we are come to the end of time, we may then bid farewell to that delightful Sun and Moon, and the other planets, that move so beautifully round her in their orbits, and all things here below, and ascend to that new Jerusalem, where we shall not want these tapers, for God is the Light thereof; where the Wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest.</p>

<p style='text-align:center'>
Then shall we hear and see and know,<br>
All we desired and wished below,<br>
And every power find sweet employ,<br>
In that eternal world of Joy.<br>
Our flesh shall slumber in the ground,<br>
Till the last trumpet’s joyful sound,<br>
Then burst the chains with sweet surprise,<br>
And in our Savior’s image rise.<br>
Go in Peace my Brothers and be leaders of men.</p>";
